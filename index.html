Our fighters are many but we are spread across the great desert. Be warned, we do not accept every volunteer.  You will need to prove that you are worth more as a fighter than you are for your bodies' water.</p>

                        <p>Living in the desert of Arrakis is dangerous. Should you be accepted, we offer a few features to help ease the mind.</p>
        
                    <ul>
                        <li>An alliance with House Atreides. We have a mutual respect between the Fremen and the Atreides which allows us to enter into populated areas with less suspicion; though our ways ae still questioned by many.</li>
        
                        <li>Traveling across the desert is dangerous. We can offer a way to travel a great distance. While this method is dangerous, it is also very efficient.  </li>
        
                        <li>Coffee service.</li>

                        <p>Our direct enemies are House Harkonnen. These outsiders ravage our land in front of our eyes. Their cruelty to our people is all we've known for years. Our warriors have yet to free Arrakis from the Harkonnens.</p>
                    <p>More recently, the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV of House Corrino, began sending his own troops, the Sardaukar, to aid the Harkkonnen; The Sardaukar are more formidable than the Harkonnen soldiers, and these armies seem never ending; despite their loss of more soldiers at each encounter.</p>
