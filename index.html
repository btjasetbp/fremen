            <h2>Join Now!</h2>
            <p>Prove yourself and join the Fremen Army! Enemy off-worlders are invading our territories. Our Sietches are threatened. Our fighters are many but we are spread across the great desert.</p>

            <img src="">

            <p>Be warned, we do not accept every volunteer.  You will need to prove that you are worth more as a fighter than you are for your bodies' water. Through the Fremen you will learn many skills, or perhaps increase a skill you have already learned. Some of these skills include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Fighting in the Weirding Way</li>
                <li>Water collection and conservation</li>
                <li>The Sandwalk</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Living in the desert of Arrakis is dangerous. Should you be accepted, we offer a few features to help ease the mind.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>An alliance with House Atreides. We have a mutual respect between the Fremen and the Atreides which allows us to enter into populated areas with less suspicion; though our ways ae still questioned by many.</li>

                <li>Traveling across the desert is dangerous. We can offer a way to travel a great distance. While this method is dangerous, it is also very efficient.  </li>

                <li>Our coffee service is the best on Arrakis.</li>
            </ul>
