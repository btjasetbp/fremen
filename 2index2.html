                    <h3>Duncan Idaho</h3>
                                <p>The Swordmaster for House Atreides. The Atreides appeared to garner fierce loyalty from those who served them, and Duncan is no different. As the Atreides Swordmaster he maintains a hypervigilance awareness against potential threats to the Atreides</p>
                                <p>Duncan was charged by Duke Leto with training his son Paul in the art of war. This involved hand-to-hand combat and military strategy. These skills Duncan imparted on the young Paul in conjunction with Gurney Halleck and the Mentat Thufir Hawat. Having trained Paul who was very young, Duncan protected Paul not only out of obligation, but as if Paul was a younger brother; as family.</p>

                    <h3>Gurney Halleck</h3>
                                <p>The Warmaster for House Atreides. He is a ruthless yet noble and romantic warrior of enormous talent. He is perhaps Duke Leto's most trusted General. Described as "an ugly lump of a man," he is regarded the most loyal of friends to those he loves, and to those he hates there are few enemies more terrifying.
                                <p>Gurney is a talented minstrel who is skilled in the use of the baliset, which he often plays to entertain friends, subordinates and guests. Halleck is also fond of reciting the Orange Catholic Bible and memorized an appropriate verse for almost every situation. At times his quotes were so fitting that they were nearly prophetic.
                                <p>Halleck's fighting abilities were second to none. With sword or knife, few opponents lasted more than a few moments - even battle-hardened Sardaukar. In the service with House Atreides, Gurney instructed Paul in shielded melee combat.

This meant protection for Atreides family members, anti-espionage, and risk management. hroughout the Imperium, Hawat has a formidable reputation. He is known in the Landsraad to be both cunning and honourable. Indeed, other Great Houses coveted him for his abilities as a strategist, warrior, and trusted advisor.
                                <p>Hawat has been entrusted with the training of the Ducal Heir Paul in the arts of war, as well as political and military strategy.

                    <h3>Stilgar</h3>
                                <p>The Fremen Naib of Sietch Tabr. Stilgar is an extremely wise and honorable man of high standing within the Fremen community. Upon the change of the Arrakis fief from House Harkonnen to House Atreides, Stilgar was befriended by Atreides Swordmaster Duncan Idaho, who had been sent in advance by Duke Leto Atreides to gauge and study the Fremen. In Idaho's reports to Leto, Idaho had judged Stilgar to be a 'good example' of the Fremen of Arrakis. Indeed, through Idaho's relationship with Stilgar and his tribe, he became so impressed with the Fremen and their ways that Idaho accepted dual loyalties to the Atreides and to Stilgar.
                                <p>Stilgar soon became a good friend of Paul's which led to Paul working close with Stilgar to fight against the enemies of House Atreides and Fremen.
