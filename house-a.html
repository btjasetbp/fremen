                        <h2>Duke Leto Atreides</h2>
                        <p>Duke Leto Atreides is the planetary governor of the ocean planet Caladan. Born into House Atreides, a noble family with a long history of honor and duty, Leto inherited the dukedom upon his father's death and quickly established himself as a just and respected leader, both among his subjects and his noble peers. A model of strong but fair governance over his organized but spiritually content society, Duke Leto became a prominent player in the Landsraad, much to the Padishah Emperor's concern.  
                        <p>Leto has not married due to political reasons.  However, Lady Jessica has been his concubine for more than a decade. She is a Bene Gesserite and bound to the Atreides family. She is the Mother of Paul, the son of Leto.
                        <p>Duke Leto has constructed a peaceful alliance with the Fremen in order to try and maintain peace on Arrakis. His main concerns are keeping his family safe and doing his duty for his people and for the Great Houses and the Padishah Emperor.</p>

                        <h2>Lady Jessica</h2>
                        <p>Jessica was raised and educated from birth by the Bene Gesserit, who intended to breed her to House Atreides heir Duke Leto and produce a daughter. At first the Bene Gesserit plan appeared to work perfectly. Jessica became the concubine of Duke Leto, which left him free to marry should such a union prove advantageous. However, their relationship soon grew into genuine love - a love that caused Jessica to disobey her orders and conceive a son for her Duke.
                        <p> After the birth of their son, Paul, Jessica began training Paul in the ways of the Bene Gesserit. Jessica believed that she could skip a generation in the Bene Gesserit plan to produce the Kwisatz Hadarach - a superbeing with powerful prescience.
                        <p>Now having an alliance with the Fremen on Arrakis and being a Bene Gesserit, Jessica has become a Reverend Mother for the Fremen; taking over for the previous one who became too old to continue.</p>

                        <h2>Paul Atreides</h2>
                        <p>Paul grew up with a privileged background on the water-rich planet of Caladan, the ancestral Atreides home. Though he lacked companions his own age, he received tutelage from his teachers — men like Thufir Hawat, Duncan Idaho, Gurney Halleck and Dr. Wellington Yueh — as well as deep education in Bene Gesserit methods and techniques from his mother. Paul's father revealed to him that his training, through his teachers, had been geared toward turning Paul into a mentat. The theory was that when Paul succeeded his father as Duke of House Atreides, one of the most respected and moral Great Houses of the Imperium, a mentat-duke would truly be a formidable force in the Landsraad.
                        
                        <p>Paul accompanied his parents when House Atreides relocated to the desert world of Arrakis to manage mining operations of the spice melange. Before their departure, Gaius Helen Mohiam, Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother and the Emperor's Truthsayer, tested him with the gom jabbar. The test was to discover whether Paul was "truly human" by trial of pain, using a small box that Paul placed his hand inside. The pain inflicted on Paul was caused by nerve induction and clearly drained an incredible amount of energy from the Reverend Mother, since no male or female child had ever withstood that much physical pain before.

                        <p>Paul is nearly assassinated by a hunter-seeker being piloted by a Harkonnen soldier hiding in the walls of the Arrakeen Palace. After surviving the attempt, Paul puts his training to use and joins the Fremen to help strategically take down the enemies of the Atreides,

                    <p>More recently, the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV of House Corrino, began sending his own troops, the Sardaukar, to aid the Harkkonnen; The Sardaukar are more formidable than the Harkonnen soldiers, and these armies seem never ending; despite their loss of more soldiers at each encounter.</p>
