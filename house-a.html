                        <h2>Duke Leto Atreides</h2>
                        <p>Duke Leto Atreides is the planetary governor of the ocean planet Caladan. Born into House Atreides, a noble family with a long history of honor and duty, Leto inherited the dukedom upon his father's death and quickly established himself as a just and respected leader, both among his subjects and his noble peers. A model of strong but fair governance over his organized but spiritually content society, Duke Leto became a prominent player in the Landsraad, much to the Padishah Emperor's concern.  
                        <p>Leto has not married due to political reasons.  However, Lady Jessica has been his concubine for more than a decade. She is a Bene Gesserite and bound to the Atreides family. She is the Mother of Paul, the son of Leto.
                        <p>Duke Leto has constructed a peaceful alliance with the Fremen in order to try and maintain peace on Arrakis. His main concerns are keeping his family safe and doing his duty for his people and for the Great Houses and the Padishah Emperor.</p>

                        <h2>Lady Jessica</h2>
                        <p>She was raised and educated from birth by the Bene Gesserit, who intended to breed her to House Atreides heir Duke Leto and produce a daughter. At first the Bene Gesserit plan appeared to work perfectly. Jessica became the concubine of Duke Leto, which left him free to marry should such a union prove advantageous. However, their relationship soon grew into genuine love - a love that caused Jessica to disobey her orders and conceive a son for her Duke.
                        <p> After the birth of their son, Paul, Jessica began training Paul in the ways of the Bene Gesserit. Jessica believed that she could skip a generation in the Bene Gesserit plan to produce the Kwisatz Hadarach - a superbeing with powerful prescience.
                        <p>Now having an alliance with the Fremen on Arrakis and being a Bene Gesserit, Jessica has become a Reverend Mother for the Fremen; taking over for the previous one who became too old to continue.</p>

                        <li>An alliance with House Atreides. We have a mutual respect between the Fremen and the Atreides which allows us to enter into populated areas with less suspicion; though our ways ae still questioned by many.</li>
        
                        <li>Traveling across the desert is dangerous. We can offer a way to travel a great distance. While this method is dangerous, it is also very efficient.  </li>

                    <p>More recently, the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV of House Corrino, began sending his own troops, the Sardaukar, to aid the Harkkonnen; The Sardaukar are more formidable than the Harkonnen soldiers, and these armies seem never ending; despite their loss of more soldiers at each encounter.</p>
